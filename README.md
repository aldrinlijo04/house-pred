# SALES-PRICE_PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

## OVERVIEW
```
New beginning Make a fresh breadth about.This is the beginning of my machine learning adventure as I take new, enjoyable turns in the industry.Predictions are the main topic of this notebook.The idea of knowing something far away in a short period of time—well, not quite a short period of time, as I spent several days creating this—is intriguing.Using a variety of machine learning algorithms, this notebook forecasts the sales price of a property taking into account all the relevant criteria.

    - Huber regression
    - Random Forest Regression

## TYPICAL ORDER OF CREATING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
=> Data Collection: Gather the data relevant to your problem from various sources.

=> Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handle missing values: Impute or remove missing data points.
Data transformation: Normalize, scale, or log-transform numerical features if necessary.
Outlier detection: Identify and handle outliers to ensure they don't bias the analysis.

=> Feature Selection:
Choose the relevant features that are most informative for the target variable.
Outlier detection can help in identifying irrelevant or noisy features.

=> Feature Engineering:
Create new features or transformations based on insights from the data and domain knowledge.
Outlier detection can inspire feature engineering to handle extreme values more effectively.

=> Model Building:
Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm based on the problem (e.g., regression, classification, clustering).
Train the model on the preprocessed data.

=> Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using validation techniques (e.g., cross-validation).
Assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

=> Model Tuning and Improvement:
Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and architecture to optimize performance.
Iteratively improve the model based on evaluation results.


=> Model Deployment:
Deploy the trained and validated model to make predictions on new data.
